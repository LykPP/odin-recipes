    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>No grill, no problemo! Here's how to make an incredible burger indoors on the stove. An optional quick seasoning mix takes it to the next level.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>

    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon black pepper</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
    
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>Prepare the optional burger seasoning mix:</li></h3>
        <p>Before you start cooking, prepare the seasoning mix. In a small bowl, mix together the salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Set aside</p>

        <h3><li>Make the sauce:</li></h3>
        <p>In another small bowl, mix the mayonnaise, mustard, and ketchup together until smooth. Set aside.</p>
        
        <h3><li>Form the burgers:</li></h3>
        <p>Preheat a large sturdy skillet (cast iron is best) over medium heat. 

            Loosely divide the ground beef into three 1/3-pound patties. Shape into discs about 1/2 inch thick and put a divot in the center of each patty to prevent swelling in the center. Season the patties with 1/2 teaspoon of seasoning mix per side of the patty, if using.</p>

        <h3><li>Cook the burgers:</li></h3>
        <p>Turn on the fan over the stove and open a window to help with air flow. 

            Spray your skillet with a little non-stick spray and place burgers in the skillet. Press down on each patty with a spatula for 10 seconds. This is to encourage browning. 
            
            Cook the burgers over medium heat for 4 minutes. Donâ€™t touch them too much so you get a nice crust on the first side. Use a sturdy metal spatula to flip the burgers, being sure to scrape up any caramelization with the burger.</p>
